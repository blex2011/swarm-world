## Integration with Claude Flow

The system integrates seamlessly with Claude Flow through:
- **Pre-task hooks**: Initialize memory coordination
- **Post-edit hooks**: Record memory operations
- **Notification hooks**: Store memory decisions
- **Post-task hooks**: Complete tasks with performance analysis

## Usage Examples

### Basic Agent Operations
```python
manager = SwarmMemoryManager("agent-1", "production-swarm")
manager.initialize_agent_memory({"role": "processor"})
manager.store_agent_decision("task_assignment", {"task": "data_proc"})
manager.record_task_outcome("data_processing", ["agent-1"], True, 30.0)
```

### Coordination and Learning
```python
# Get strategy recommendation
strategy = manager.get_coordination_strategy({"task_type": "processing"})

# Share knowledge with swarm
manager.share_knowledge_with_swarm("optimization", {"strategy": "parallel"})

# Monitor memory health
health = manager.get_memory_health_report()
```

## Configuration Options

### Memory Limits
- Individual agent memory: 100MB
